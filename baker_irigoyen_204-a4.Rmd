```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(decisionSupport)

```

## Data Setup

```{r data}

war <- read_csv(here("warming.csv")) %>%  # add warming data
  rename("id" = "X1")

dam <- read_csv(here("damages.csv")) # add damages data

pulse <- 35000000000 # tons of carbon

```

## Question 1

```{r damage function}
dam <- dam %>% 
  mutate(warm2 = warming^2) # make quadratic term

dam_deg <- lm(damages ~ 0 + warming + warm2, data = dam) # fit quadratic

dam_deg_a <- dam_deg$coefficients[[2]] # squared term
dam_deg_b <- dam_deg$coefficients[[1]] # second term
  
ggplot(dam, aes(x = warming, y = damages)) + # plot
  geom_point() + # scatter
  geom_smooth() # plot line

## how to inline reference the square term???

```

damage = `r dam_deg_a`warming^2^ + `r dam_deg_b`warming


## Question 2

```{r graphs}

war <- war %>% 
  mutate(damages_baseline = dam_deg_a*warming_baseline^2 + dam_deg_b*warming_baseline,
         damages_pulse = dam_deg_a*warming_pulse^2 + dam_deg_b*warming_pulse,
         diff_damages = damages_pulse-damages_baseline,
         diff_ton = diff_damages/pulse
         ) # calc damages

ggplot(war, aes(x = year, y = damages_baseline))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() # needs axis labs and titles

ggplot(war, aes(x = year, y = damages_pulse))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() # needs axis labs and titles

ggplot(war, aes(x = year, y = diff_damages))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() # needs axis labs and titles

ggplot(war, aes(x = year, y = diff_ton))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() # needs axis labs and titles

```


## Question 3

```{r scc}

discounts <- c(.01, .02, .03, .04, .05)

function(discount){
  (1 + discount) * x / discount
}


```


## Question 4

```{r}

```


## Question 5

```{r}

```
